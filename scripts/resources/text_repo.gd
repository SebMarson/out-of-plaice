This book contains everything you need to know about fish. More importantly, this book describes how to identify the 'good' fish from the 'bad' fish. If something doesn't look right with you catch, dispose of it as soon as possible. If you're reading this AFTER eating a bad fish, run as far away from civilization as you can..... Enjoy!"
